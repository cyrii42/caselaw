Only a handful of Alaskan invoices submitted to the district court demonstrate that the purchaser knew of the sales tax issue before completing the purchase. And on each of these invoices, the purchaser was provided a discount on the transaction equal to or greater than the amount of improper sales tax, with at least some of the discounts provided for the express purpose of offsetting the sales tax.A nd, as discussed below, any purchaser who received a discount in an amount greater than or equal to the improper sales tax for the purpose of offsetting the sales tax never paid the improper tax at all.</p> <p>Because these purchasers did not pay the sales tax, or at least their invoices do not demonstrate that they paid the sales tax, their invoices are not sufficient evidence that any class member knew of the sales tax and then paid it.

It may be that a few outlier putative class members do not satisfy the class definition. RHI may present this evidence to the jury, and such persons may be excluded from the class, either by the jury or the Court in post-trial motions. But hypothesizing that some persons on the class list may fall outside the class definition is insufficient to defeat predominance, which \u201ctests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\u201d See Amchem Prods., Inc. v.

The Court disagrees. It is a mechanism by which RHI can show that some persons fall outside the class definition, but it does not shift Magallon\u2019s burden on predominance. RHI provided no evidence that any persons fall outside the class definition, let alone enough people to cast doubt on predominance. The Court simply allows RHI to provide evidence if there are persons that should be excluded from the class so that this can be done at the earliest possible time, but class members often are excluded during the claims process for not falling within the class definition, sometimes at the defendant\u2019s behest, and that does not shift the burden of predominance or destroy predominance.

RentGrow, Inc., 341 F.R.D. 174, 192 (D. Md. 2022), rev\u2019d on other grounds, No. 22-1619, 2024 WL 4138658 (4th Cir. Sept. 11, 2024)</p> <p>Although [Dalton v. Capital Assoc. Indus., Inc., 257 F.3d 409 (4th Cir. 2001)] found insufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury\u2019s finding of willfulness, it is distinguishable from this case. There, the challenged procedure involved a subvendor\u2019s reliance on the legal opinion of a court clerk\u2014which resulted in the inaccurate listing of a prior conviction as a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. Dalton, 257 F.3d at 413. The Dalton court concluded that a plaintiff failed to show this inaccuracy was willful because the plaintiff did not show that the credit reporting agency \u2018was aware that its subvendors relied upon informal legal opinions from court clerks\u2019 and failed to present evidence that other consumers lodged similar complaints. Id. at 418. In addition, the agency had generally found the subvendor to be \u2018reliable,\u2019 and corrected its error one day after the plaintiff challenged the accuracy of the report. Id. Here, in contrast, it is clear that RentGrow was aware of its own procedures for finding and reporting OFAC information. Further, although the dispute rate is of RentGrow\u2019s OFAC reporting practice is low, Mr. Fernandez has successfully shown that at least 71 individuals filed complaints similar to his own. Far from finding its process to be \u2018reliable,\u2019 RentGrow has not identified any individual who was accurately matched to the OFAC list through its name-only search procedure.</p> </li> </ul> <p>RentGrow also points to the 0.1% dispute rate it received during the putative class period, explaining that the Sixth Circuit reversed a jury verdict due to insufficient evidence of willfulness where the procedure in question had a 0.2% dispute rate. Even in light of Mr. Fernandez\u2019s emphasis that \u2018many consumers simply are not in a position to dispute [their tenant report], especially here, where English may be a second language to many of the affected customers,\u2019 the OFAC reporting procedure\u2019s 0.1% dispute rate nonetheless weakens Mr. Fernandez\u2019s arguments that the 71 disputes RentGrow received over the course of the putative class period demonstrates that it knew its procedures violated the FCRA.</p>"},{"location":"fcra/fcra/#15-usc-1681i-reinvestigations","title":"15 U.S.C \u00a7 1681i (Reinvestigations)","text":"<p>\u00a7 1681i(a)(1)(A):  Subject to subsection (f) and except as provided in subsection (g), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer\u2019s file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph (5), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.</p> <ul> <li>McKeown v.

You not only know it is wrong, but it leads you to question everything you heard before it. It isn\u2019t First Advantage\u2019s accuracy rate as applied to all consumers that matters; it is First Advantage\u2019s accuracy rate as applied to common-name consumers. Although neither party presented definitive evidence on that issue, it is far more likely that one would erroneously match a common-name consumer than a unique-name consumer.

But as Plaintiff points out, given the large number of reports issued, even this low rate ensnared over 13,000 people during this time period. Plaintiff, however, never showed how many of the erroneous reports generated for these 13,000+ people arose from use of an inadequate common-name procedure.

Indus., Inc., 257 F.3d 409 (4th Cir. 2001)] found insufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury\u2019s finding of willfulness, it is distinguishable from this case. There, the challenged procedure involved a subvendor\u2019s reliance on the legal opinion of a court clerk\u2014which resulted in the inaccurate listing of a prior conviction as a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. Dalton, 257 F.3d at 413. The Dalton court concluded that a plaintiff failed to show this inaccuracy was willful because the plaintiff did not show that the credit reporting agency \u2018was aware that its subvendors relied upon informal legal opinions from court clerks\u2019 and failed to present evidence that other consumers lodged similar complaints. Id. at 418. In addition, the agency had generally found the subvendor to be \u2018reliable,\u2019 and corrected its error one day after the plaintiff challenged the accuracy of the report. Id. Here, in contrast, it is clear that RentGrow was aware of its own procedures for finding and reporting OFAC information. Further, although the dispute rate is of RentGrow\u2019s OFAC reporting practice is low, Mr. Fernandez has successfully shown that at least 71 individuals filed complaints similar to his own. Far from finding its process to be \u2018reliable,\u2019 RentGrow has not identified any individual who was accurately matched to the OFAC list through its name-only search procedure.</p> </li> </ul> <p>RentGrow also points to the 0.1% dispute rate it received during the putative class period, explaining that the Sixth Circuit reversed a jury verdict due to insufficient evidence of willfulness where the procedure in question had a 0.2% dispute rate. Even in light of Mr. Fernandez\u2019s emphasis that \u2018many consumers simply are not in a position to dispute [their tenant report], especially here, where English may be a second language to many of the affected customers,\u2019 the OFAC reporting procedure\u2019s 0.1% dispute rate nonetheless weakens Mr. Fernandez\u2019s arguments that the 71 disputes RentGrow received over the course of the putative class period demonstrates that it knew its procedures violated the FCRA.</p>"},{"location":"standing/fcra/","title":"FCRA Cases","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Trans Union, LLC v.
