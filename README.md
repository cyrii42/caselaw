## Fair Credit Reporting Act
### [15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681e) (Maximum Possible Accuracy)
> Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

#### Cases re CRA Failure to Consider Conflicting Information

Ga. 2013)
- *Bryant v. TRW, Inc.*, 487 F. Supp. 1234, 1242 (E.D. Mich. 1980) (refusing to set aside a jury verdict finding that a consumer reporting agency failed to follow reasonable procedures for failing to detect inconsistencies between a September report containing derogatory information and an earlier May report on which such information did not appear, even though at least one of the derogatory items predated the May report, and noting that a contrary reading of the FCRA “would make [a CRA] simply a conduit and eliminate from the Act its emphasis on the reasonableness of the procedures followed in putting together a consumer report. This is not what Congress intended.”)

July 24, 2003) (denying MSJ on § 1681e(b) claim where TransUnion issued consumer report with deceased indicator despite “internal inconsistencies,” including an account-opening date four years before plaintiff was born and a deceased notation on just one of “approximately two dozen” accounts)
- *McKeown v. Sears Roebuck & Co.*, 335 F. Supp. 2d 917, 925–26, 936 (W.D. Wis. 2004) (denying MSJ on § 1681i “reasonable reinvestigation” claim where plaintiff disputed deceased indicator on report and TransUnion thereafter “knew or should have known that [credit furnisher’s] information was not trustworthy” because furnisher’s automated dispute response “verified plaintiff's name as a whole but reported that the middle initial and last name . . . did not match the one on the account”)

#### "Technically Accurate" Cases



- [*Gomez v. Kroll Factual Data, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I9180e3c3610911e39ac8bab74931929c/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 20 F. Supp. 3d 1103, 1107 (D. Colo. 2013) (rejecting argument that "a notation of 'similar to' is not inaccurate because nothing in the Consumer Report states that Plaintiff is either Gabriel Gomez Chavez or any other individual on the OFAC List")




- [*Fernandez v. RentGrow, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Icec48860abcb11ec95f7f56bb3f79725/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 341 F.R.D. 174, 192 (D. Md. 2022), *rev'd on other grounds*, No. 22-1619, 2024 WL 4138658 (4th Cir. Sept. 11, 2024)
  >RentGrow argues that its inclusion of an OFAC alert on Mr. Fernandez's tenant screening report was not technically inaccurate because it merely listed Mr. Fernandez as a 'possible match' to an individual on the OFAC list, rather than a match. In support of this contention, RentGrow cites two cases—neither of which are from this Circuit—that awarded summary judgment to the defendant credit reporting agency where the defendant did not 'wrongfully attribute' inaccurate criminal information to the subject of the report and instead either warned the report requester that the criminal record may not belong to the subject, or included additional information about the criminal record itself that the report requester could use to verify whether the record belonged to the subject. *Erickson v. First Advantage Background Servs. Corp.*, 981 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir. 2020); *see also Taylor v. Tenant Tracker, Inc.*, Civ. No. BSM-10-0282, 2011 WL 5402388 (E.D. Ark. Nov. 4, 2011). Accepting this argument would cause the Court to interpret the FCRA in a way that is simply unsupported by the text of § 1681e(b), which requires 'maximum possible accuracy' rather than mere technical accuracy.

- [*Dalton v. Cap. Associated Indus., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I066ab4a479b811d9bf29e2067ad74e5b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 257 F.3d 409, 415 (4th Cir. 2001) ("A [consumer] report is inaccurate when it is patently incorrect or when it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to have an adverse effect." (cleaned up))

- [*Patel v. Trans Union, LLC*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I49d881801e5411e5be1ff4cec5913d5d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 308 F.R.D. 292, 302 (N.D. Cal. 2015)
  > The issue of accuracy is a core issue for ascertainability and the predominance of common issues. The defendants' fundamental quarrel is with the plaintiff's assertion that tagging the class members as (for example) 'terrorists' (via the name-only logic) is always inaccurate and thus is enough to define the class (and establish the predominance of this common issue). The defendants counter that the plaintiff cannot show, except file by file, that the SmartMove reports wrongly tagged the class members as terrorists. They complain that the plaintiff cannot just assert that the terrorist tags were inaccurate and then shift the burden to the defendants to prove that the tags were accurate.
  > 
  > Normally, the defendants would be right. But this case presents a peculiar situation. The defendants' implied argument is that a significant number of the proposed class actually may have been accurately tagged as potential terrorists. Absent some pretty significant proof to the contrary, the court is willing to assume that no significant (read: certification-breaking) fraction of the tagged proposed class was in fact accurately tagged as potential terrorists.


### [15 U.S.C § 1681n](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681n) (Willfulness)

#### Arguments Based on "Industry Standards"
- [*Williams v. First Advantage LNS Screening Sols., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ic55bfd80ffe611e6b28da5a53aeba485/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 238 F. Supp. 3d 1333, 1347 n.17 (N.D. Fla. 2017), *rev'd in part on other grounds*, 947 F.3d 735 (11th Cir. 2020) (rejecting argument on post-trial JMOL from CRA defendant that it had been "acting as a reasonably prudent consumer reporting agency" because it "met or exceeded industry standards," and noting that "the jury could have concluded . . . that the entire consumer-reporting industry violated the FCRA" (cleaned up))

#### Arguments Based on "Dispute Rates"
- [*Williams v. First Advantage LNS Screening Sols., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ic55bfd80ffe611e6b28da5a53aeba485/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 238 F. Supp. 3d 1333, 1344 (N.D. Fla. 2017), *rev'd in part on other grounds*, 947 F.3d 735 (11th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up)
  > Nevertheless, First Advantage argues, and argued *ad nauseam* at trial, that their procedures "did and do in fact assure maximum possible accuracy because during the relevant time period First Advantage accurately matched criminal records with consumers 99.62% of the time." That argument is like the thirteenth chime of a clock. You not only know it is wrong, but it leads you to question everything you heard before it. It isn't First Advantage's accuracy rate as applied to all consumers that matters; it is First Advantage's accuracy rate as applied to common-name consumers. Although neither party presented definitive evidence on that issue, it is far more likely that one would erroneously match a common-name consumer than a unique-name consumer. Common sense thus suggests that many of the 14,346 'not-me” errors were for common-name consumers.

First Advantage LNS Screening Sols., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ic55bfd80ffe611e6b28da5a53aeba485/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 238 F. Supp. 3d 1333, 1346 n.15 (N.D. Fla. 2017), *rev'd in part on other grounds*, 947 F.3d 735 (11th Cir. 2020) ("This Court acknowledges that there is no direct evidence in the record of other erroneous first name, last name, and date of birth matches. But given the sheer number of 'not-me' or 'not-mine' errors—errors where the records contained in the background report are not that of the job applicant—the jury could have reasonably inferred that others, and likely many others, have occurred.")
  
- [*Williams v. First Advantage LNS Screening Sols., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I687bb510334111ea9076f88ee0fd553a/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 947 F.3d 735, 763-64 (11th Cir. 2020) (**in punitive-damages analysis**)
  > In mitigation, Defendant argues that its overall error rate between 2010 and 2013 was quite low, which is true: the rate nationally for all types of errors identified through the dispute resolution process, not just the ones involved in this case, was only 0.38%. But as Plaintiff points out, given the large number of reports issued, even this low rate ensnared over 13,000 people during this time period. Plaintiff, however, never showed how many of the erroneous reports generated for these 13,000+ people arose from use of an inadequate common-name procedure. So, it is impossible for us, on this record, to assess the extent of the notice to Defendant that its practices were resulting in the dissemination of incorrect reports.
  
- [*Fernandez v. RentGrow, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Icec48860abcb11ec95f7f56bb3f79725/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 341 F.R.D. 174, 192 (D. Md. 2022), *rev'd on other grounds*, No. 22-1619, 2024 WL 4138658 (4th Cir. Sept. 11, 2024)
  > Although [[*Dalton v. Capital Assoc. Indus., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I066ab4a479b811d9bf29e2067ad74e5b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 257 F.3d 409 (4th Cir. 2001)] found insufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury's finding of willfulness, it is distinguishable from this case. There, the challenged procedure involved a subvendor's reliance on the legal opinion of a court clerk—which resulted in the inaccurate listing of a prior conviction as a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. *Dalton*, 257 F.3d at 413. The *Dalton* court concluded that a plaintiff failed to show this inaccuracy was willful because the plaintiff did not show that the credit reporting agency 'was aware that its subvendors relied upon informal legal opinions from court clerks' and failed to present evidence that other consumers lodged similar complaints. *Id.* at 418. In addition, the agency had generally found the subvendor to be 'reliable,' and corrected its error one day after the plaintiff challenged the accuracy of the report. *Id.* Here, in contrast, it is clear that RentGrow was aware of its own procedures for finding and reporting OFAC information. Further, although the dispute rate is of RentGrow's OFAC reporting practice is low, Mr. Fernandez has successfully shown that at least 71 individuals filed complaints similar to his own. Far from finding its process to be 'reliable,' RentGrow has not identified any individual who was accurately matched to the OFAC list through its name-only search procedure.

  > RentGrow also points to the 0.1% dispute rate it received during the putative class period, explaining that the Sixth Circuit reversed a jury verdict due to insufficient evidence of willfulness where the procedure in question had a 0.2% dispute rate. Even in light of Mr. Fernandez's emphasis that 'many consumers simply are not in a position to dispute [their tenant report], especially here, where English may be a second language to many of the affected customers,' the OFAC reporting procedure's 0.1% dispute rate nonetheless weakens Mr. Fernandez's arguments that the 71 disputes RentGrow received over the course of the putative class period demonstrates that it knew its procedures violated the FCRA.

  > **§ 1681i(a)(1)(A)**:  Subject to subsection (f) and except as provided in subsection (g), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer’s file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph (5), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. 258, 276, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014))
  >
  > As pertains to the voluntary payment issue raised by LuLaRoe, LuLaRoe failed to provide sufficient evidence that any class member would lack a meritorious claim on this basis. Only a handful of Alaskan invoices submitted to the district court demonstrate that the purchaser knew of the sales tax issue before completing the purchase. And on each of these invoices, the purchaser was provided a discount on the transaction equal to or greater than the amount of improper sales tax, with at least some of the discounts provided for the express purpose of offsetting the sales tax.A nd, as discussed below, any purchaser who received a discount in an amount greater than or equal to the improper sales tax for the purpose of offsetting the sales tax never paid the improper tax at all.
  > 
  > Because these purchasers did not pay the sales tax, or at least their invoices do not demonstrate that they paid the sales tax, their invoices are not sufficient evidence that any class member knew of the sales tax and then paid it. The invoices, then, are not sufficient evidence that the individualized issue of voluntary payment bars recovery on at least some claims.
  >
  >The fashion retailer declarations suffer from the same problem. Although the declarations generally assert that some consumers across the country were told of the sales tax issue, the declarations do not state with certainty that any member of this Alaska class was informed of the nature of the improper sales tax, was not provided a discount, and paid the sales tax nonetheless.
  >
  >***We do not permit a defendant to support its invocation of individualized issues with mere speculation.*** See True Health, 896 F.3d at 932. LuLaRoe's scant evidence of voluntary payment is not sufficient to defeat predominance.

A defendant can produce evidence of a predominance-defeating consent defense in a variety of ways. But we do not consider the consent defenses that McKesson might advance or for which it has presented no evidence.")

  > Regarding RHI's assertion in its reply brief and at oral argument that some class members may have immediately been deemed "not placeable" based on obviously disqualifying events like major felonies, RHI offers no evidence of any class member who falls within this category. It may be that a few outlier putative class members do not satisfy the class definition. RHI may present this evidence to the jury, and such persons may be excluded from the class, either by the jury or the Court in post-trial motions. But hypothesizing that some persons on the class list may fall outside the class definition is insufficient to defeat predominance, which "tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation." See *Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor*, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997).
  
  > RHI also argues that requiring RHI to provide evidence that some people fall outside the class definition improperly shifts the burden to RHI to prove predominance. The Court disagrees. It is a mechanism by which RHI can show that some persons fall outside the class definition, but it does not shift Magallon's burden on predominance. RHI provided no evidence that any persons fall outside the class definition, let alone enough people to cast doubt on predominance. The Court simply allows RHI to provide evidence if there are persons that should be excluded from the class so that this can be done at the earliest possible time, but class members often are excluded during the claims process for not falling within the class definition, sometimes at the defendant's behest, and that does not shift the burden of predominance or destroy predominance. Predominance does not require 100% of class members or putative class members ultimately to fall within the class definition.
