### [15 U.S.C § 1681n](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681n) (Willfulness)

#### Arguments Based on "Industry Standards"
- [*Williams v. First Advantage LNS Screening Sols., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ic55bfd80ffe611e6b28da5a53aeba485/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 238 F. Supp. 3d 1333, 1347 n.17 (N.D. Fla. 2017), *rev'd in part on other grounds*, 947 F.3d 735 (11th Cir. 2020) (rejecting argument on post-trial JMOL from CRA defendant that it had been "acting as a reasonably prudent consumer reporting agency" because it "met or exceeded industry standards," and noting that "the jury could have concluded . . . that the entire consumer-reporting industry violated the FCRA" (cleaned up))

#### Arguments Based on "Dispute Rates"
- [*Williams v. First Advantage LNS Screening Sols., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ic55bfd80ffe611e6b28da5a53aeba485/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 238 F. Supp. 3d 1333, 1344 (N.D. Fla. 2017), *rev'd in part on other grounds*, 947 F.3d 735 (11th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up)
  > Nevertheless, First Advantage argues, and argued *ad nauseam* at trial, that their procedures "did and do in fact assure maximum possible accuracy because during the relevant time period First Advantage accurately matched criminal records with consumers 99.62% of the time." That argument is like the thirteenth chime of a clock. You not only know it is wrong, but it leads you to question everything you heard before it. It isn't First Advantage's accuracy rate as applied to all consumers that matters; it is First Advantage's accuracy rate as applied to common-name consumers. Although neither party presented definitive evidence on that issue, it is far more likely that one would erroneously match a common-name consumer than a unique-name consumer. Common sense thus suggests that many of the 14,346 'not-me” errors were for common-name consumers.
