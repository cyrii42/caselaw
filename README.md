## Fair Credit Reporting Act
### [15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681e) (Maximum Possible Accuracy)
> Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.

- [*Taylor v. Screening Reps., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ibbd41f1016db11e8b7ce8230219a322d/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), No. 11-cv-03426, 2013 WL 12328948, at *5-7 (N.D. Ga. July 16, 2013), *report and recommendation adopted in relevant part*, 294 F.R.D. 680 (N.D. Ga. 2013)
    > Here, I conclude that the Dougherty County records are properly authenticated because they have been certified under seal by a deputy clerk of the Dougherty County Superior Court.5 (See Doc. 96, Soumilas Decl., Exh. 5, Dougherty County Records at 2). These records reveal that Michael Lee Taylor has a different social security number and a different date of birth from Plaintiff Taylor. (Compare Doc. 96, Soumilas Decl., Exh. 5, Dougherty County Records at 5 with SMF, Exh. M). Although Plaintiff Taylor does not describe how he obtained the court records, I will draw a reasonable inference that SRI also would have been able to obtain those records if the company had sent a researcher to the Dougherty County courthouse.Save to Folder
