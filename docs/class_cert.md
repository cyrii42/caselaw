  > The issue of accuracy is a core issue for ascertainability and the predominance of common issues. The defendants’ fundamental quarrel is with the plaintiff’s assertion that tagging the class members as (for example) ‘terrorists’ (via the name-only logic) is always inaccurate and thus is enough to define the class (and establish the predominance of this common issue). The defendants counter that the plaintiff cannot show, except file by file, that the SmartMove reports wrongly tagged the class members as terrorists. They complain that the plaintiff cannot just assert that the terrorist tags were inaccurate and then shift the burden to the defendants to prove that the tags were accurate.
  > 
  > Normally, the defendants would be right. But this case presents a peculiar situation. The defendants’ implied argument is that a significant number of the proposed class actually may have been accurately tagged as potential terrorists. Absent some pretty significant proof to the contrary, the court is willing to assume that no significant (read: certification-breaking) fraction of the tagged proposed class was in fact accurately tagged as potential terrorists.

  > ***If the plaintiff demonstrates that class issues exist, the defendant must invoke individualized issues and provide sufficient evidence that the individualized issues bar recovery on at least some claims, thus raising the spectre of class-member-by-class-member adjudication of the issue.*** See True Health Chiropractic, Inc. v. McKesson Corp., 896 F.3d 923, 932 (9th Cir. 2018) (“[W]e do not consider ... defenses that [the defendant] might advance or for which it has presented no evidence.” (emphasis added)).
  >
  > If the defendant provides evidence that a valid defense—affirmative or otherwise—will bar recovery on some claims, then the district court must determine, based on the particular facts of the case, “whether individualized questions ... ‘will overwhelm common ones and render class certification inappropriate under Rule 23(b)(3).’ ” Olean, 31 F.4th at 669 (quoting Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U.S. 258, 276, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014))

  > As pertains to the voluntary payment issue raised by LuLaRoe, LuLaRoe failed to provide sufficient evidence that any class member would lack a meritorious claim on this basis. Only a handful of Alaskan invoices submitted to the district court demonstrate that the purchaser knew of the sales tax issue before completing the purchase. And on each of these invoices, the purchaser was provided a discount on the transaction equal to or greater than the amount of improper sales tax, with at least some of the discounts provided for the express purpose of offsetting the sales tax.A nd, as discussed below, any purchaser who received a discount in an amount greater than or equal to the improper sales tax for the purpose of offsetting the sales tax never paid the improper tax at all.
  > 
  > Because these purchasers did not pay the sales tax, or at least their invoices do not demonstrate that they paid the sales tax, their invoices are not sufficient evidence that any class member knew of the sales tax and then paid it. The invoices, then, are not sufficient evidence that the individualized issue of voluntary payment bars recovery on at least some claims.
  >
  >The fashion retailer declarations suffer from the same problem. Although the declarations generally assert that some consumers across the country were told of the sales tax issue, the declarations do not state with certainty that any member of this Alaska class was informed of the nature of the improper sales tax, was not provided a discount, and paid the sales tax nonetheless.
  >
  >***We do not permit a defendant to support its invocation of individualized issues with mere speculation.*** See True Health, 896 F.3d at 932. LuLaRoe’s scant evidence of voluntary payment is not sufficient to defeat predominance.

  > Regarding RHI’s assertion in its reply brief and at oral argument that some class members may have immediately been deemed “not placeable” based on obviously disqualifying events like major felonies, RHI offers no evidence of any class member who falls within this category. It may be that a few outlier putative class members do not satisfy the class definition. RHI may present this evidence to the jury, and such persons may be excluded from the class, either by the jury or the Court in post-trial motions. But hypothesizing that some persons on the class list may fall outside the class definition is insufficient to defeat predominance, which “tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.” See *Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor*, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997).

  > **FN 11**: RHI also argues that requiring RHI to provide evidence that some people fall outside the class definition improperly shifts the burden to RHI to prove predominance. The Court disagrees. It is a mechanism by which RHI can show that some persons fall outside the class definition, but it does not shift Magallon’s burden on predominance. RHI provided no evidence that any persons fall outside the class definition, let alone enough people to cast doubt on predominance. The Court simply allows RHI to provide evidence if there are persons that should be excluded from the class so that this can be done at the earliest possible time, but class members often are excluded during the claims process for not falling within the class definition, sometimes at the defendant’s behest, and that does not shift the burden of predominance or destroy predominance. Predominance does not require 100% of class members or putative class members ultimately to fall within the class definition.
