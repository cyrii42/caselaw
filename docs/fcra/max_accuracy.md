- [*Taylor v.

Supp. 1234, 1242 (E.D. Mich. 1980) (refusing to set aside a jury verdict finding that a consumer reporting agency failed to follow reasonable procedures for failing to detect inconsistencies between a September report containing derogatory information and an earlier May report on which such information did not appear, even though at least one of the derogatory items predated the May report, and noting that a contrary reading of the FCRA “would make [a CRA] simply a conduit and eliminate from the Act its emphasis on the reasonableness of the procedures followed in putting together a consumer report. This is not what Congress intended.”)

- [*Stewart v. Credit Bureau, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Ic96c9aa3945111d9bc61beebb95be672/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 734 F.2d 47, 52 (D.C.

Supp. 2d 917, 925–26, 936 (W.D. Wis. 2004) (denying MSJ on § 1681i “reasonable reinvestigation” claim where plaintiff disputed deceased indicator on report and TransUnion thereafter “knew or should have known that [credit furnisher’s] information was not trustworthy” because furnisher’s automated dispute response “verified plaintiff’s name as a whole but reported that the middle initial and last name . . . did not match the one on the account”)

- [*Gohman v. Equifax Info.

Minn. 2005) (denying MSJ on § 1681e(b) claim where CRA issued “at least five” consumer reports with inaccurate deceased notation received from one furnisher, even though “numerous other accounts were opened or remained active” and deceased notation was therefore “plainly inconsistent with other information in [plaintiff’s] file”)

- [*Pulley v. Sterling Bancorp*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I255648d0807711ef90d7c8460fab65be/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), No. 23-1800, 2024 WL 4357222 (3d Cir. Oct. 1, 2024) (non-precedential order) (Restrepo, Freeman, McKee, JJ.) (reversing district court’s grant of summary judgment to TU & EXP on § 1681e(b) “negligent noncompliance” claim where CRAs (i) reported in June & July 2020 that plaintiff’s account with creditor was current, then (ii) in August 2020, reported that plaintiff’s account with same creditor was 90 days delinquent)
  > A reasonable jury could find that reporting a 90-day delinquency was inconsistent with the absence of a 30-or 60-day delinquency. Upon making that finding, a reasonable jury could also find that the agencies acted negligently by failing to verify that inconsistent information. *See Stewart v. Credit Bureau, Inc.*, 734 F.2d 47, 52 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“Certainly, inconsistencies within a single file or report . . . can provide sufficient ground for inferring that an agency acted negligently in failing to verify information.”). 

## “Technical Accuracy” Cases

- [*Gomez v. Kroll Factual Data, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I9180e3c3610911e39ac8bab74931929c/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 20 F. Supp. 3d 1103, 1107 (D. Colo. 2013) (rejecting argument that “a notation of ‘similar to’ is not inaccurate because nothing in the Consumer Report states that Plaintiff is either Gabriel Gomez Chavez or any other individual on the OFAC List”)

- [*Fernandez v. RentGrow, Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/Icec48860abcb11ec95f7f56bb3f79725/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 341 F.R.D. 174, 192 (D. Md. 2022), *rev’d on other grounds*, No. 22-1619, [2024 WL 4138658](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I2876b310705a11efbff58ae190e56f6b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0) (4th Cir. Sept. 11, 2024)
  >RentGrow argues that its inclusion of an OFAC alert on Mr. Fernandez’s tenant screening report was not technically inaccurate because it merely listed Mr. Fernandez as a ‘possible match’ to an individual on the OFAC list, rather than a match. In support of this contention, RentGrow cites two cases—neither of which are from this Circuit—that awarded summary judgment to the defendant credit reporting agency where the defendant did not ‘wrongfully attribute’ inaccurate criminal information to the subject of the report and instead either warned the report requester that the criminal record may not belong to the subject, or included additional information about the criminal record itself that the report requester could use to verify whether the record belonged to the subject. *Erickson v. First Advantage Background Servs. Corp.*, 981 F.3d 1246, 1252 (11th Cir. 2020); *see also Taylor v. Tenant Tracker, Inc.*, Civ. No. BSM-10-0282, 2011 WL 5402388 (E.D. Ark. Nov. 4, 2011). Accepting this argument would cause the Court to interpret the FCRA in a way that is simply unsupported by the text of § 1681e(b), which requires ‘maximum possible accuracy’ rather than mere technical accuracy.

Associated Indus., Inc.*](https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I066ab4a479b811d9bf29e2067ad74e5b/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0), 257 F.3d 409, 415 (4th Cir. 2001) (“A [consumer] report is inaccurate when it is patently incorrect or when it is misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be expected to have an adverse effect.” (cleaned up))
