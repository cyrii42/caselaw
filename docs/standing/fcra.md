Congress exercised its judgment in choosing to make a credit inquiry without a permissible purpose a legally cognizable injury, and as other courts in this district have noted, the FCRA “makes no distinction between hard and soft inquiries; either is permissible if made for an appropriate purpose.” McMahan v. Byrider Sales of Indiana S, LLC, No. 3:17-CV-00064-GNS, 2017 WL 4077013, at *1, n. 1 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 14, 2017) (citing Bowling v. Scott Lowery L. Off., P.C., No. 5:13-CV-00091-TBR, 2014 WL 3942280, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 12, 2014)); see 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a)(3)(A).5 As noted above, a soft credit inquiry “bears a close relationship to the kind of injury protected by the common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion; and [the] claimed harm directly correlates with the protections enshrined by Congress” in the FCRA. Dickson, 69 F.4th at 349. Accordingly, Malcolm has plausibly alleged that he suffered a concrete injury-in-fact sufficient for Article III standing purposes. As a result, Defendants’ motions to dismiss for lack of standing [DE 60; DE 65] are DENIED
